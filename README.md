Audio File Transcriber using Cloudflare Workers AI
This project provides a web interface to transcribe audio from a user-uploaded file using Cloudflare's serverless platform and the Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model.

How It Works
Frontend: A simple HTML page with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript provides the user interface. The user selects an audio or video file from their device, optionally selects a language, and submits the form.

Backend (Cloudflare Worker): The frontend uploads the file in a POST request to a Cloudflare Worker.

Transcription: The worker receives the file data and passes it directly to the Whisper model, which is made available through an AI binding configured in the wrangler.toml file.

Response: The worker sends the transcribed text back to the frontend, where it is displayed to the user.

This approach is fully self-contained and does not require any external services for downloading or processing.

Setup and Deployment
Prerequisites:

A Cloudflare account.

Node.js and npm installed.

Wrangler CLI installed (npm install -g wrangler).

Configure Wrangler:

Log in to your Cloudflare account using wrangler login.

Create Your Project:

Place index.js inside a src directory.

Place index.html and wrangler.toml in the root of your project directory.

Deploy the Worker:

Open your terminal in the project's root directory.

Run wrangler deploy. This will publish your worker script (src/index.js) to the Cloudflare network.

Host the Frontend:

The simplest way to host the index.html file is using Cloudflare Pages.

Create a new Pages project and connect it to the Git repository containing your files.

In your Pages project's settings, go to Settings > Functions > Service bindings and add a binding to your deployed worker. This allows your frontend to communicate with the worker seamlessly.

This setup provides a scalable, cost-effective, and powerful solution for AI-driven audio transcription.
