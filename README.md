YouTube Audio Transcriber using Cloudflare Workers AI
This project provides a web interface to transcribe the audio from a YouTube video using Cloudflare's serverless platform and the Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model.

How It Works
Frontend: A simple HTML page with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript provides the user interface. The user enters a YouTube video URL, selects a language, and submits the form.

Backend (Cloudflare Worker): The frontend sends a POST request to a Cloudflare Worker.

Audio Extraction (Important Note): The worker is designed to extract the video ID from the YouTube URL. However, directly downloading audio from YouTube within a Cloudflare Worker is not feasible due to technical limitations and YouTube's Terms of Service. The provided worker code includes a simulation of the transcription process. To build a fully functional application, you must integrate a service to handle the audio extraction. This could be another serverless function or a dedicated server that uses a library like ytdl-core.

Transcription: Once the audio data is obtained, the worker passes it to the Whisper model, which is made available through a binding configured in the wrangler.toml file.

Response: The worker sends the transcribed text back to the frontend, where it is displayed to the user.

Setup and Deployment
Prerequisites:

A Cloudflare account.

Node.js and npm installed.

Wrangler CLI installed (npm install -g wrangler).

Configure Wrangler:

Log in to your Cloudflare account using wrangler login.

Create Your Project:

Place index.js inside a src directory.

Place index.html and wrangler.toml in the root of your project directory.

Deploy the Worker:

Open your terminal in the project's root directory.

Run wrangler deploy. This will publish your worker script (src/index.js) to the Cloudflare network.

Host the Frontend:

The simplest way to host the index.html file is using Cloudflare Pages.

Create a new Pages project and connect it to the Git repository containing your files.

In your Pages project's settings, go to Settings > Functions > Service bindings and add a binding to your deployed worker. This allows your frontend to communicate with the worker seamlessly.

Implement the Audio Extraction Service:

This is the most critical step to make the application fully functional. You will need to create a separate service that can take a YouTube video ID and return an audio stream or file.

Update the fetch function in src/index.js to call this new service to get the audio data before sending it to the Whisper model.

This setup provides a scalable, cost-effective, and powerful solution for AI-driven audio transcription.
